While the traditions and teachings of ancient\n        Greeks and Eastern philosophies dominate the modern global psyche of\n        wisdom, the Celts held some of the most meaningful keys to knowing\n        oneself.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        They contended that each individual favored one aspect each of two\n        three-fold realms: those of sea, sky, or field and those of mind, heart,\n        or body. An individual&rsquo;s internal harmonies of these realms reveal\n        deep symbolic truths about oneself.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        However, for millennia, this system was lost&mdash;or hidden&mdash;from\n        the world. Only in 1987 did this ancient wisdom begin to surface.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Encoded in the songs of Enya is the lost wisdom of the Celts. Whether by\n        her intent, or some providential fortune, this musician has offered the\n        gift of this ancient way once more.&nbsp;\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The Enyagram uncovers, organizes, and elucidates what is hidden in the\n        songs of Enya. By using 9 songs of Enya, the Enyagram offers a\n        personality profile that will reveal one&rsquo;s realms and the inner\n        workings of their very self.\n      </p>\n      <a href=\"/quiz\" className=\"btn btn-primary p-4 home-button\">\n        Take the Quiz\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </>\n);\nexport default About;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport App from \"../App\";\nimport NotFound from \"./NotFound\";\nimport Home from \"./Home\";\nimport About from \"./About\";\n\nconst Router = () => (\n  <BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>\n    <Switch>\n      <Route exact path={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/\"} component={Home} />\n      <Route path={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/about\"} component={About} />\n      <Route path={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + \"/quiz\"} component={App} />\n      <Route component={NotFound} />\n    </Switch>\n  </BrowserRouter>\n);\n\nexport default Router;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport Router from \"./components/Router\";\n\nReactDOM.render(<Router />, document.getElementById(\"root\"));\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
